Pink Man is an engaging 2D game in which players navigate through eight main levels filled with various obstacles, traps, collectibles, and enemies. The main goal is to save the princess in order to win the game successfully. Players will play as a character in a pink suit - or “Pink Man” - as they traverse throughout the game. The player is allowed to use their keyboard’s arrow keys to navigate throughout the game levels. They can also use the spacebar to jump over obstacles and continue further into each level. The goal of this game is to complete all eight levels as well as collect 30 oranges, 30 kiwis, 30 strawberries, and all four of the princess’s precious items in order to finally save the princess and win the game!
